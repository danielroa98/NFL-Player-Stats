    ## About this section

    The main usage for the _Passing_ section is to better understand and analyze passing statistics players had during a season.

    Just as the other sections, it may be from a past or current season.

    ## About the data

    ## How can I filter the data?

    As far as _Passing_ goes, it uses the same parameters as the other sections, you can filter by the following attributes:
    * Season
        * The seasons range from 1980 to the current season.
            * As an additional note, __
