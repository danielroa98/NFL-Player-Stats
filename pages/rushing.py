    ## About this section
    The main usage for the _Rushing_ section is to better understand and analyze the rushing statistics the players had during a season.

    It can be a past season or a current season.

    ## About the data
    Some players have been in multiple teams throughout a season, that's why you may find some team names such as __2TM__.

    At the moment, the data from these players will be managed as if they had belonged to a team named "__2TM__" or whichever amount of teams they've been at in a single season.

    ## How can I (as a user) filter the data?
    It's pretty easy, in the sidebar you'll find a section titled _Sort data_ in there you'll have the following options to filter the data:
    - Season
        - The seasons range from 1980 to the current season (2022).
    - Team 
    - Position
    - Player age
