    ## Why was this project born?
    I've always been a bigger baseball fan, and during the COVID pandemic, I started to get more and more curious about player stats.
    
    Another thing that I recently started picking up, was watching NFL matches. Since I'm new to this sport, I wanted to better understand player stats, how each position works, and so on.
    So I decided to build a dashboard to better analyze player stats and try to understand better how one's stats are above or below a certain team, or the league as a whole.

    One of the things I decided to implement as well, was past seasons, since I want to better understand why some players are considered better than others.
