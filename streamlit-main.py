        ## Why was this project born?
        I've always been a bigger baseball fan, and during the COVID pandemic, I started to get more and more curious about player stats.
        
        Another thing that I recently started picking up, was watching NFL matches. Since I'm new to this sport, I wanted to better understand player stats, how each position works, and so on.
        So I decided to build a dashboard to better analyze player stats and try to understand better how one's stats are above or below a certain team, or the league as a whole.

        One of the things I decided to implement as well, was past seasons, since I want to better understand why some players are considered better than others.

        ## How to navigate this project? üîç
        As you can see there's a sidebar that's divided into two sections:
        - The first section doesn't have a name (yet), but here you can navigate between pages. It's divided into the following pages:
            - streamlit-main: it's the landing page, containing additional information (such as this manual).
            - passing: `work in progress`
            - receiving: `work in progress`
            - rushing: contains the necessary information to better analyze and understand player stats and the team's averages.
                - May implement additional features.
        - The second section is meant to give additional information on player actions.
            - Each section has information regarding the data that's being managed, what the stats represent.
